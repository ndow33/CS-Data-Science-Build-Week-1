# Implement this code

After forking and cloning this repo, please use run.py as a working example of how to implement this code.

You should only ever have to call the fit and predict methods found in decision_tree.py to make any predictions. Again, see the run.py file for a working example with the iris dataset.

If you would like to better understand how the algorithm works, you can run visual_tree.py. It will print out different aspects of the algorithm as the _grow_tree method is recursively called.
